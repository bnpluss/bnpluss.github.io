I am a serial entrepreneur who is always on the go. This is my personal blog where I will blog about anything and everything that interests me. I am one of the co-founders of Race Roster, and that is currently my sole pursuit.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can use the contact form here, or interact with me via one (or more) of the social media services listed below. I hope you will find some value in the posts that I write on this blog. Keep on mixing & mangling.
